\title{Streaming Version of the Matrix Reduction}

\maketitle

\section{The Problem}

This document addresses one of the primary challenges of computing persistent homology on streaming 
data by a fully incremental approach.  As a data stream is a potentially infinite sequence of data 
objects, the entire stream cannot be stored in the memory typically available to a computer.  
Therefore, the computation of persistent homology on streaming data requires an incremental 
approach.  A couple of computational models for applying persistent homology on data streams are 
being developed as two separate projects.  Consistent with the standard computational paradigm 
\cite{silva-13} for processing data streams, each of those two models consists of two principal 
components: (i) \emph{online}, and (ii) \emph{offline}.  However, yet another (\emph{i.e.}, a 
third) computational model can be developed for computing of persistent homology on streaming data 
by a \emph{fully online} or \emph{fully incremental} approach.  This document attempts to develop 
the theoretical foundation for performing the \emph{Gaussian elimination} (also called the 
\emph{reduction}) 


The standard algorithm \cite{edelsbrunner-00, zomorodian-05} \emph{reduces} the boundary matrix 
$\partial$ of a filtration \cite{zomorodian-10} to the column-echelon form $R$.  Usually, the 
entire boundary matrix or a simplified data structure thereof is processed in the memory while the 
standard algorithm is executed.  This approach is not desirable when computing persistent homology 
on streaming data.    When 
working with data streams, one would want to add a simplex $\sigma$ to the already reduced matrix 
$R$ without having to recompute the reduction of other columns due to the addition of $\sigma$.  
Ideally, only the column of $\sigma$ should be reduced as the simplex $\sigma$ is added to the 
filtration.
