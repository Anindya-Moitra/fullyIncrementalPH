\title{Streaming Version of the Matrix Reduction}

\maketitle

\section{The Problem}

This document addresses one of the primary challenges of computing persistent homology on streaming 
data by a fully incremental approach.  

This document attempts to develop the theoretical foundation of performing \emph{Gaussian 
elimination} of the boundary 


The standard algorithm \cite{edelsbrunner-00, zomorodian-05} \emph{reduces} the boundary matrix 
$\partial$ of a filtration \cite{zomorodian-10} to the column-echelon form $R$.  Usually, the 
entire boundary matrix or a simplified data structure thereof is processed in the memory while the 
standard algorithm is executed.  This approach is not desirable when computing persistent homology 
on streaming data.  As a data stream is a potentially infinite sequence of data objects, the entire 
stream cannot be stored in the memory typically available to a computer.  Therefore, the 
computation of persistent homology on streaming data requires an incremental approach.  When 
working with data streams, one would want to add a simplex $\sigma$ to the already reduced matrix 
$R$ without having to recompute the reduction of other columns due to the addition of $\sigma$.  
Ideally, only the column of $\sigma$ should be reduced as the simplex $\sigma$ is added to the 
filtration.
