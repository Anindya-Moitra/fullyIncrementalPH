# fullyIncrementalPH: A Python Library To Compute "Fully Incremental" Persistent Homology

The first model for the computation of persistent homology on streaming data was introduced by [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9346556). Another model was later developed that increased the 'incrementalism' of the previous model. This model was developed as part of a [C++ library](https://github.com/wilseypa/lhf) for fast computation of persistent homology.
